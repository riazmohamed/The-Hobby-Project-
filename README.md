# UK Motorbike Adventures Website

## Project Overview
A personal website showcasing motorbike riding experiences across the United Kingdom. Built as a beginner web development project using HTML, CSS, and basic Tailwind concepts.

## Technical Approach

### Structure & Navigation
- **4 Main Pages**: Home, Routes, My Bike, Gallery
- **Consistent Navigation**: Fixed header with active state indicators
- **Semantic HTML5**: Uses proper elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`

### Design Philosophy
- **Motorbike Theme**: Black (#1a1a1a), red (#ff3333), and white color scheme
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoints at 768px and 480px
- **User Experience**: Clear visual hierarchy with hover effects and transitions

### Technical Implementation

#### HTML Structure
- Clean, semantic markup for accessibility
- External CSS linking (no inline styles)
- Placeholder images with descriptive alt text
- Form elements for user interaction (gallery page)

#### CSS Architecture
- **Mobile-first responsive design**
- **CSS Grid and Flexbox** for layouts
- **Consistent spacing system** using rem units
- **Smooth transitions** for interactive elements
- **Component-based styling** for reusability

#### Key Features
- **Sticky navigation** for easy access to all pages
- **Card-based layouts** for content organization
- **Image galleries** with hover effects
- **Contact form** with proper form elements
- **Responsive typography** that scales across devices

### Content Strategy
- **UK-specific routes**: Snake Pass, Cat and Fiddle, Hardknott Pass, Cheddar Gorge
- **Personal touch**: Bike specifications, gear details, maintenance tips
- **Visual storytelling**: Photo gallery with location-based content
- **Community aspect**: Contact form for sharing experiences

### Accessibility Considerations
- Semantic HTML for screen readers
- Alt text for all images
- Clear color contrast
- Keyboard navigation support
- Responsive design for various devices

### Future Enhancements
- Real photos from rides
